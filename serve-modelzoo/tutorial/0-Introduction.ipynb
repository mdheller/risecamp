    "Welcome to the Clipper tutorial at RISE Camp 2018. This tutorial consists of two independent parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Part 1](1-Clipper-API.ipynb) provides a detailed explanation of Clipper, its architecture, and the Python API. You will explore these themes through the deployment of a `scikit-learn` model that classifies flowers based on their Sepal Length and Sepal Width.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Part 2](2-Example-App.ipynb) will walk you through a more realistic use case of Clipper by deploying a PyTorch container, as well as a custom container running a Darknet YOLO V3 (You Only Look Once) model. The PyTorch model is a SqueezeNet model that will allow you to classify images of your choosing. The Darknet YOLO (You Only Look Once) model can be used to draw bounding boxes around objects and label these objects in images. This will be a great opportunity to observe the Clipper API at work, as well as a chance to play around with some fun models.\n",
